; You will get more detailed reports (busy etc) if you have a call limit set
; for a device. When the call limit is filled, we will indicate busy. Note that
; you need at least 2 in order to be able to do attended transfers.
;
; For queues, you will need this level of detail in status reporting, regardless
; if you use SIP subscriptions. Queues and manager use the same internal interface
; for reading status information.
;
; Note: Subscriptions does not work if you have a realtime dialplan and use the
; realtime switch.

; Setting this to yes, enables T.38 fax (UDPTL) passthrough on SIP to SIP calls, provided
; both parties have T38 support enabled in their Asterisk configuration

; disable it on a per device basis. 
;
; T.38 faxing only works in SIP to SIP calls, with no local or agent channel being used.
;
; t38pt_udptl = yes            ; Default false

; The externip, externhost and localnet settings are used if you use Asterisk
; behind a NAT device to communicate with services on the outside.

; no reason for Asterisk to stay in the media path, the media will be redirected.
; This does not really work with in the case where Asterisk is outside and have

;----------------------------------------- SIP DOMAIN SUPPORT ------------------------
; Incoming INVITE and REFER messages can be matched against a list of 'allowed'
; domains, each of which can direct the call to a specific context if desired.
; By default, all domains are accepted and sent to the default context or the
; context associated with the user/peer placing the call.
; Domains can be specified using:
; domain=<domain>[,<context>]
; Examples:
; domain=myasterisk.dom
; domain=customer.com,customer-context
;
; In addition, all the 'default' domains associated with a server should be
; added if incoming request filtering is desired.
; autodomain=yes
;
; To disallow requests for domains not serviced by this server:
; allowexternaldomains=no

;domain=mydomain.tld,mydomain-incoming
                                ; Add domain and configure incoming context
                                ; for external calls to this domain
;domain=1.2.3.4                 ; Add IP address as local domain
                                ; You can have several "domain" settings
;allowexternalinvites=no        ; Disable INVITE and REFER to non-local domains
                                ; Default is yes
;autodomain=yes                 ; Turn this on to have Asterisk add local host
                                ; name and local IP to domain list.

; fromdomain=mydomain.tld       ; When making outbound SIP INVITEs to
