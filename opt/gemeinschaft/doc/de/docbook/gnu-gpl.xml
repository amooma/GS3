  <title>GNU General Public License (GPL)</title>

  <section id="gpl-preamble">
    <title>Preamble</title>

    <para>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software - to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's
    software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some
    other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library
    General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,
    too.</para>

    <para>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
    the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
    programs; and that you know you can do these things.</para>

    <para>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</para>

    <para>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
    have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
    code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</para>

    <para>We protect your rights with two steps: <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>copyright the software, and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
          copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.</para>

    <para>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program
    will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
    proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
    be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</para>

    <para>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.</para>

    <title>Terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification</title>

    <?dbhtml stop-chunking?>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-0">
      <title>Section 0</title>

      <para>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
      the terms of this General Public License. The <quote>Program</quote>,
      below, refers to any such program or work, and a <quote>work based on
      the Program</quote> means either the Program or any derivative work
      under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
      portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
      into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
      limitation in the term <quote>modification</quote>.) Each licensee is
      addressed as <quote>you</quote>.</para>

      <para>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
      not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
      running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
      is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
      (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
      is true depends on what the Program does.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-1">
      <title>Section 1</title>

      <para>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
      source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
      conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
      copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
      that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
      any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with
      the Program.</para>

      <para>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
      and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
      fee.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-2">
      <title>Section 2</title>

      <para>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
      of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
      such modifications or work under the terms of <link
      linkend="gpl-terms-and-conditions-1">Section 1</link> above, provided
      that you also meet all of these conditions: <orderedlist
          numeration="loweralpha">
          <listitem>
            <para>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
            stating that you changed the files and the date of any
            change.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
            in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
            part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
            parties under the terms of this License.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If the modified program normally reads commands
            interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running
            for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or
            display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice
            and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
            provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
            under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
            this License. (Exception: If the Program itself is interactive but
            does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
            the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist></para>

      <para>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
      can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
      the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
      License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
      whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
      it.</para>

      <para>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
      contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent
      is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Program.</para>

      <para>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
      Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
      volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work
      under the scope of this License.</para>

      <para>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work
      for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
      code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
      compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
      exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
      executable.</para>

      <para>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
      access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
      to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
      the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
      source along with the object code.</para>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-4">
      <title>Section 4</title>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
      except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-5">
      <title>Section 5</title>

      <para>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
      signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
      distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
      modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
      its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
      Program or works based on it.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-6">
      <title>Section 6</title>

      <para>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
      these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
      on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
      responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
      License.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-7">
      <title>Section 7</title>

      <para>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
      so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
      any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
      distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
      not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
      receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.</para>

      <para>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
      under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
      intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
      other circumstances.</para>

      <para>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
      any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
      integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
      by public license practices. Many people have made generous
      contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
      system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
      the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
      software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
      choice.</para>

      <para>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
      to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="gpl-terms-and-conditions-8">
      <title>Section 8</title>

      <para>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
      original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
      add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
      countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
      not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
      limitation as if written in the body of this License.</para>

      versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
      versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</para>

      <para>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
      Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it
      and <quote>any later version</quote>, you have the option of following
      the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
      published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not

      Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
      sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the

    <para>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.</para>

    <para>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
    the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
    <quote>copyright</quote> line and a pointer to where the full notice is
    found.</para>
