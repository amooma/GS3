ChangeLog

Version 2.0.0 (Sun, Dec 02 2007)
* implemented updated EncodeQP (thanks to coolbru, aka Marcus Bointon)
* finished all testing, all known bugs corrected, enhancements tested
- note: designed for PHP4, but will work with PHP5 (not compatible with
  E_STRICT) ... full PHP5 version of PHPMailer released separately. 
  PHP5 version will NOT work with PHP4.

Version 2.0.0 rc2 (Fri, Nov 16 2007), interim release
* implements new property to control VERP in class.smtp.php
  example (requires instantiating class.smtp.php):
  $mail->do_verp = true;
* POP-before-SMTP functionality included, thanks to Richard Davey
  (see class.pop3.php & pop3_before_smtp_test.php for examples)
* included example showing how to use PHPMailer with GMAIL
* fixed the missing Cc in SendMail() and Mail()

******************
A note on sending bulk emails:

If the email you are sending is not personalized, consider using the 
"undisclosed-recipient:;" strategy. That is, put all of your recipients
in the Bcc field and set the To field to "undisclosed-recipients:;". 
It's a lot faster (only one send) and saves quite a bit on resources.
Contrary to some opinions, this will not get you listed in spam engines -
it's a legitimate way for you to send emails.

A partial example for use with PHPMailer:

$mail->AddAddress("undisclosed-recipients:;");
$mail->AddBCC("email1@anydomain.com,email2@anyotherdomain.com,email3@anyalternatedomain.com");

Many email service providers restrict the number of emails that can be sent
in any given time period. Often that is between 50 - 60 emails maximum
per hour or per send session.

If that's the case, then break up your Bcc lists into chunks that are one
less than your limit, and put a pause in your script.

* fixed warning message in SMTP get_lines method
